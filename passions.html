	My Teaching Experience:
  <p class="w3-justify">After my school work, I spend most of my weeks as a Peer Teacher for Texas A&M Engineering teaching Engineering 111, 112, 102, and 216.

	<p class="w3-justify">

I am currently working in my sixth semester as a Peer Teacher! I really love the work and the satisfaction of helping students succeed in their academics and determining their study paths.

	<p class="w3-justify">

My work as a peer teacher includes me assisting the primary instructor with class lecture, lab assignments, and course grading. 
My first teaching experience began my first semester in college where I worked as a TA in Chemistry 1470 with Dr. Carl Aronson at Blinn College. 
I began as a Texas A&M Peer Teacher for Engineering 111 in my Sophomore Fall semester with Dr. Natalia Ostrovskaya. 
I worked the next 3 semesters as a Peer Teacher for Engineering 111 & 112 with Dr. Allen Godwin.

Why Teaching?
	<p class="w3-justify">

My passion for teaching and learning has been persistent for many years. As a child, I would always teach the neighborhood kids about some historical event so we could reenact it in the street. Growing up, teaching began to develop as my primary study habit. I would often find that I not only learned better when I taught the material to fellow classmates, but I found genuine joy in helping others learn something. Seeing others’ eyes light up in understanding filled me with a sense of fulfillment. 
	<p class="w3-justify">
In fact, it was an acute absence of a teacher which made me first realize how important they are. Because my father was in Iraq for most of my childhood, I learned my early life lessons from historical figures, from Gene Kranz’s “Failure is not an option!” to Davy Crockett’s “Be sure you are right then go on ahead!” I found that Albert Einstein provided me with the greatest lesson to teach by, “It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.” It was my 8th grade History teacher, Ms. McCarthy, that spurred my love for history even further and first showed me the “supreme art” of the teacher. She had endless enthusiasm and spirit when it came to teaching. She either came to class everyday dressed as a figure from that days lecture, or she brought in historical artifacts related to the day’s topic. It was after experiencing her class I first thought to myself that I would love to have that kind of impact on someone’s education.

I carried my teaching passion into college where I have been able to develop my teaching skills. My freshman year I served as a Teaching Assistant in Chemistry for Engineers at Blinn College. At the same time, I worked on campus as a tutor for several courses including Math, History, Biology, and Political Science. When I transferred to Texas A&M, I continued teaching by assuming the position of Peer Teacher for Engineering 111, 112 and 102. I currently am working in this position and I have had so much joy in helping prospective students learn and succeed.
	<p class="w3-justify">
My experience teaching in college became one of the primary factors of why I switched majors. Although my parents greatly disapproved and I enjoyed the math of Mechanical Engineering (as is evident by my current Peer Teacher position and my Mathematics minor), I knew that I enjoyed teaching more and needed to follow that passion. I knew that to reach my true teaching potential, I needed to focus on the subject that has been a drive for me all my life, from my childhood friends reenacting battles to Ms. McCarthy’s class: History.
	<p class="w3-justify">
The first semester after switching majors, my decision was affirmed. I was teaching a recitation section for Engineering 111. Towards the end of the semester I made the students aware that these recitation sessions were being discontinued by the departement. One student, Charles, came up to me after class and told me that canceling these classes was a disservice to future students because I was the reason he was succeeding in class and enjoyed it so much. The emotion I felt after he told me this was indescribable and had crushed any doubt I had had in my decision to pursue teaching.

What is my plan now?
	<p class="w3-justify">
Upon completing my Masters and getting certified, I plan to return to my old high school, Friendswood, or to one of the surrounding school districts. I do not plan to just teach; I would very much like to coach golf, baseball or Academic Decathlon, if not a combination of the three. After getting certified in History, I plan to complete the content exams for other subjects including Math, Geography, Government, Physics, and Economics. In the future I would like to take my years of experience and get my EdD. My ultimate goal is to be able to help my students recognize the joy of learning and succeed not only in their studies, but in discovering themselves
