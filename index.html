  <p class="w3-justify">Howdy!

My name is Raymond Brian Monahan and I am a undergraduate student at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor's of Art in History. I am currently a senior planning to graduate in May. My passions are research, golfing, going to athletic events and teaching.
  <p class="w3-justify">
My first goal after undergraduate studies is to pursue a Masters in Education with Texas Teaching Certification in History, Social Studies and Mathematics.
My long-term professional aspirations are to become a high school teacher, a high school golf coach, and eventually get my EdD. or PhD.
  <p class="w3-justify">
To accomplish these goals I have my Bachelor's in History, a minor in Mathematics, and make frequent trips to the Texas A&M Campus Course and The Legends Course.
Furthermore, I have applied to the Texas A&M Education Department's Masters with Certification program while continuing to develop my golf game.
  <p class="w3-justify">
My undergraduate research focus has been on the History of Germany, 18th & 19th Century America, and my Capstone on Carribean Pirates during the 16th and 17th centuries.
