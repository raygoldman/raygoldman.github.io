During the Fall of 2018, I spent time abroad in Berlin, Germany! This amazing opportunity introduced me to many new cultures, foods, and friends. I enjoyed the opportunity to test my German knowledge and capabilities, and I cannot wait for the opportunity to return.

The above two photos are from the Aggie Deutschklub. The first is from a Bierstunde during my first semester in the organization. The second is of us celebrating Tag der Deutschen Einheit / German Unity Day in the Fall 2018.

Tespa is a collegiate esports organization I joined to help sponsor the growth of collegiate esports for the welfare of gamer athletes. I have participated in events both on campus and out of town including CWL Fort Worth hosted by MLG.

I have been a member of the Gold Prospectors Association of America for almost 10 years! While it has been just as long since I last made a trip up to Alaska to do some prospecting, I do enjoy keeping up to date with articles and shows.

My oldest organization to be a part of is the Fraternal Catholic Czech Society of Texas. My grandmother purchased me a life-long membership when I was born. Since then I have been to a variety of events. I tailgate with former Aggies and current KJZT members before every home football game.
