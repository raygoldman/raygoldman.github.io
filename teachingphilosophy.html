<section class="w3-container w3-center w3-content" style="max-width:800px">
  <h2 class="w3-wide">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This is my personal philosophy on teaching.</i></p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
My teaching philosophy follows this quote by Einstein, “Das geistige Wachstum sollte bei der Geburt beginnen und erst beim Tod aufhören.” 
I believe that intellectual growth lasts from birth to death; we never stop learning. 
What I hope to never fail to prioritize is that both myself and the students must always be learning. 
	<p class="w3-justify">
As the teacher, it is my responsibility to ensure that students are learning, and learning what is important. 
I emphasize how my material will be impactful for their students and when possible educate the students on life skills so that even 
if they forgot all the content from school, they still receive an education. 
While, to the best of my ability, I teach the material that has been so enjoyable to learn for me, I understand that not everyone is a student of history, 
and I must work to make my class impactful for everyone beyond the content of the course.
	<p class="w3-justify">
As a history teacher, my passion for history has grown because I have been introduced to the exciting event and connections throughout history. As a teacher I 
must introduce my students to all of these events and more that grew my passion so that I can foster passion in them. From the events of history I hope to educate
students to learn the lessons of those who came before us so that they may grow and develop further.			     
<p class="w3-justify">
I work to foster student social skills and learning strategies by incorporating group projects and assignments into their education. 
With the application of group work I hope to foster communication with peers and the usage of drives to share material. 
A skill that will be useful for the students in their futures.  
<p class="w3-justify">
With a Bachelors in History, an Associates in Engineering, and a Minor in Mathematics, I develop connections for the students across their subjects 
so they can understand the value of the material they learn. My Field Experience and Peer Teaching work at Texas A&M has taught me that students may be learning from me, 
I must also be able to learn from them and adapt to help them learn better. 
<p class="w3-justify">
To further their learning, I understand I must always be available through email contact and tutoring either before or after school. 
From my observations, I have learned that tools such as Google Classroom are great ways of staying connected to the students, 
and I will be using tools made available to me to be to the students.
<p class="w3-justify">
The most important thing to remember is that we all must be learning. I hope to model this to the students as well as Texan core values so that 
all can grow into participating members of society. I hope that each student can leave my class feeling that they have gained knowledged, learned about history, 
and they have become a representative of the Texas spirit.
